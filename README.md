# Quantum Cryptography
As networking technology advances, there has been an upsurge in demand for secure communication channels. Many important data have been transmitted across the network, and they must be encrypted to safeguard it. **Quantum Cryptography** is one of the techniques used to ensure that all of our communication channels are protected. This project uses the BB84 protocol to mimic Quantum Cryptography with an 8-bit encryption key.
## Requirements notes
### Software
The structure is based on the use of three computers, notably Alice, Bob, and Eve, each of which controlsÂ a modular set. Arduino Mega is used to operate in each modules thus each computer requires the installation of Arduino IDE, https://www.arduino.cc/en/software. The project is tested and operated on Arduino IDE version 1.8.5.
### Hardware
Ensure that the laser's intensity is within the OPT101's operating range. In this project, the focused laser's maximum OPT101 readings in a closed room lab setting range from 570 to 650.

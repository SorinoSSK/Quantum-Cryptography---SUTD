As networking technology advances, there has been an upsurge in demand for secure communication channels. Many important data have been transmitted across the network, and they must be encrypted to safeguard it. **Quantum Cryptography** is one of the techniques used to ensure that all of our communication channels are protected. This project uses the BB84 protocol to mimic Quantum Cryptography with an 8-bit encryption key.

## Requirements notes
### Software
The project is designed with the usage of 3 computers in mind, mainly Alice, Bob and Eve where each holds a modular set. Arduino Mega is used to run all 3 modules thus each computer requires the installation of Arduino IDE. The project is tested and operated in Arduino IDE version 1.8.5.
### Hardware
Ensure that the intensity of the laser is operating within the operating range of the OPT101. In this project, the maximum OPT101 readings of the focused laser range from 570 to 650 in a closed room lab environment.
